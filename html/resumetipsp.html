			<p>Beyond the basics, these 4 tips will make your resume stand out above the rest.<br>

                Use Active Language<br>
                
                Create Focal Points<br>
                
                Use Numbers<br>
                
                Match Keywords</p>
                <p>
                    1. Use Active Language
                        Active language can make any experience description more impactful.<br><br>
                        When you are adding job descriptions to previous experiences, use power words 
                        such as “achieved,” “earned,” and “accomplished". Here are a few examples to 
                        start job descriptions with active language:<br>

                        Increased team production by 10%.<br>

                        Led a team of 3 on a special project.<br>

                        Surpassed sales quota by over 15%.<br>

			<p>2. Create Focal Points<br>
                The hiring manager is typically flooded with resume applications. So you only have about 2 minutes of their attention span.</p>
                    <br>Here are some ways you can draw their attention to the important things:

                    Put the most relevant experiences at the top, don't worry about chronology.<br>
                    
                    Bold the important parts. Don't go overboard here.<br>
                    
                    Use numbers and awards to draw attention.<br>
                    
                    Remove irrelevant experiences.<br>
            </p>

			<p>3. Use Numbers<br>
                Ever heard of the term "A Picture is Worth A Thousand Words"? Well, numbers are worth a 
                thousand words on Resumes.<br>
                Here are some ways you can use numbers:<br><br>

                    "Consistently outperformed sales targets by 10%"<br>

                    "Supported over 4 functional areas with financial analysis"<br>

                    "Increased customer satisfaction rating to 8.6/10"<br>

                    "Raised over $70,000 in the ABC fundraising campaign"<br>

                4. Match Keywords<br>
                    You will notice job descriptions will 
                    often have a lot of buzzwords or keywords on different skills or software requirements.<br><br>
                    Hiring managers will scan your resume to see if you match any of those keywords and sometimes in 
                    higher demand positions, they will do this through a bot.<br><br>

                    Take and add keywords from the job description to your resume.<br>
                    
                    Create a skill section and put some keywords in there.

			<h3 class="card-title">Some more Tips for creating your perfect Resume</h3>
			<p class="card-text">- Within our page, you will find tips with each section to help make your resume the best
				it can be. Along with these, here are some general tips:</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>
				1. Use action verbs to describe what you did - words like managed, directed, implemented, founded,
                 analyzed...<br>
                2. When possible, connect your action to the result it had - for example, 
                "Implemented a new filing system, which resulted in team members filing documents twice as fast."<br>
                3. Even if you cannot connect what you did to a direct outcome, be sure you are noting why it 
                was important. Did it show leadership? Did it make processes work better? Did it help your department
                 run more smoothly?<br>
                4. Don't be afraid to brag about yourself! This is the time to do it - just be sure that whatever 
                you say is truthful.<br>
                5. Always triple check your resume for spelling and grammar errors. An employer wants to know that 
                the person they hire has a good attention to detail and takes pride in their work product.<br>
